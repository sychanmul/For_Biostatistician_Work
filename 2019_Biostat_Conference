## Conference Summary

### I. Analysis of Longitudinal Data from Clinical Trials: Review
Presentation by 이근백(성균관대학교)
1. Analysis of Longitudinal Data
Marginal model approach: linear model, generalized estimating equation for population-averaged effects
Conditional model approach: random effect model, hierarchical model, multi-level model for subject specific effects 
For Continuous Outcomes: Linear Model, Linear Mixed Models
For Longitudinal Categorical Data: GEE, GLMM(Generalized Linear Mixed Model)
 a. Linear Model 
- based on marginal model approach
- correlation structure(Independent, Exchangeable, Exponential(Auto-Regressive), Unstructured)
- Estimator: MLE vs REML 
- REML(Restricted Maximum Likelihood) 
 b. Linear Mixed Model
- Fixed effects + Random Effects → Mixed model
- EM algorithm(original paper) vs ML or REML(nowadays) for parameter estimation
 c. GLM(Generalized Linear Model)
- Random component, Exponential family
- Link Function: Binary (logit link), Count data(log link), Nominal data(baseline-logit link)
 c. GEE(Generalilzed Estimating Equation)
- Marginal model approach
- Population-averaged effect를 구하고자 함
- Working Correlation(Exchangeable, AR(1) correlation structure를 선호)
- 장점: likelihood 계산 필요 없음, correlation model misspecification에 대해 robust
- 단점: likelihood-based model selection criteria(e.g, AIC, BIC, LRT) 사용 불가, Less efficient 
 d. GLMM(Generalized Linear Mixed Model)
- Subject-specific effect of covariates 추정 위해 사용 vs GEE는 for population-averaged effect of covariates
- Inference Approach: Conditional likelihood, Marginal likelihood 
- Estimation Methods
   - EM algorithm, Monte Carlo EM, Monte Carlo Newton-Rapahson for maximization of likelihood 
   - PQL(Penalized quasi-likelihood), Bias-Corrected PQL, Linearization for approximate likelihood

### II. Introduction to Bayesian Early Phase(phase I/II) Clinical Trial
Presentation by 진익훈(연세대학교)

1. Single-agent Phase I Trials
- to find MTD(Maximum tolerated dose)
- conventional 3+3 design is used 
- Algorithm based design(e.g, 3+3 design): based on a prespecified algorithm with poor performance 
 2. Model-Based Designs
- Dose-toxicity model is assumed and updated based on the accrued data
- superior performance, but less transparent 
- CRM(Continual Reassessment Method)
  - after each cohort of patients, the CRM updates the estimate of the dose-toxicity curve based on the accumulating data 
  - Model misspecification이 Model performance에 영향을 크게 줌
  - BMA-CRM(Bayseian Model Averaging CRM)
   - Prespecifies multiple skeletons
 3. Model-Assisted Phase I Designs 
 - dose escalation/de-escalation rule can be pretabulated before the onset of the trial 
 4. Performance Metrics
 - Accuracy: PCS(Percentage of Correct Selection) - the % of simulated trials in which the MTD is correctly selected 
 - Safety: % of simulated trials in which a toxic dose with the true DLT probability >= 33% is selected as the MTD
 - Reliability: Risk of overdosing, risk of poor allocation, risk of irrational dose assignment 

### IV. Update of Adaptive Design Guidance for Innovative Trial

2. Advantages of Adaptive Design
- Drug and Biologics 
  - Statistical Efficiency
  - Ethical considerations
  - Generalizability and improved understanding of drug effects에 유리 
 - Medical Devices
  - can be more efficient, saving time, money and resources
  - chance of trial success를 높일 수도 있음
  - may facilitate transition from premarket to postmarket follow-up
  - can enhance patient protection
  - can improve decision-making at milestones 
3. Limitations of Adaptive Design
 - Drug and Biologics 
  - require certain analytical methods to avoid erroneous conclusions and bias
  - Gains in efficiency may be offset by losses in other respects
  - Scientific constraints나 certain clinical settings에서는 efficiency gain through adaptation이 제한적일 수 있음
 - Medical Devices
  - Design 단계에서 more effort가 필요
  - 제대로 수행이 안될 경우, operational or statistical bias가 생겨 true effect를 알아내기 힘들 수 있음
  - Maximum sample size and/or study duration이 non-adaptive design에 비해 더 클 수 있음 
4. Simulation for Adaptive Trial
 - Type I error inflation 해결
  - Appeal to statistical theory(e.g, group sequential, p-value combination)
  - Using methods less prone to Type I error inflation(e.g, noncomparative SSR)
 - Simulation Report
  - overall description of the trial design
  - description of the set of parameter configurations and justification of the choices
  - Results detailing in Type I error probability and power under the various scenarios
  - Simulation code
  - Software package documentation 중요(US FDA reviewer가 simulation을 verify할 것임)
M5. inimizing Operational Bias
 - Stringent procedures for randomization, enrollment, and communication with investigators 
 - Proper Procedures 미리 갖추고 시작
 - should limit the access to outcomes by coded or unblinded treatment groups 
 - Precise details of the adaptation algorithm은 investigator에게 제공되는 Protocol과 분리되어 작성해야 함
